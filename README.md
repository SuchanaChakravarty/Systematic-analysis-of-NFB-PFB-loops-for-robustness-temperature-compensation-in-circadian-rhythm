# Temperature-compensation-in-negative-and-positive-feedback-oscillators
The codes can be useful to reproduce the results of the research article 'Temperature compensation in negative and positive feedback oscillators'. For our research we have performed the simulations, for 4 different circadian oscillators - 1. Two-Variable-Goodwin-NFB; 2. cyano-KaiABC; 3. cPNFB; and 4. Selkov-PFB. 
The codes are written in Matlab. 
Each of the previously stated network motifs has five folders with estimates for the following scenarios: Arithmatic-Mean calculation; BIC calculation; Temperature compensation with single reaction fixed; Time Course calculation; and Temperature compensation with two reactions fixed. 
To validate of our findings, we have tested the models, at different parameter regimes.
